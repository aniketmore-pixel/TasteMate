      "1504  To begin making the Paal Kozhukattai Recipe With Bananas, let us start with preparing the rice dumplings. In a small pot, bring 2 1/2 cups of water to boil. Once the water starts boiling, add sesame oil and turn off the heat.In a bowl, add rice flour and salt. Combine them together. Add water slowly little by little and mix continuously to prepare the dough. Knead the dough together to prepare a soft dough.Once the dough comes together, grease your palm with oil and roll small balls of dough . I rolled the dough into small coin shaped ones as I preferred a different shape than the usual round ones. Ensure the dough is covered with damp cloth all the time to prevent it from losing its moisture. This also prevents the dough from cracking while cooking.Repeat the same with the entire dough and prepare small coins out of the dough. Keep the rolled balls covered with damp cloth at all times.In a nonstick pan, add milk and bring it to boil. Once the milk starts boiling, reduce the heat and add shaped rice balls into the milk.Cook the rice balls for about 5 minutes without stirring. Ensure that you don’t stir the rice balls until they are cooked to avoid breaking the rice balls.The balls will float on the top once it has been cooked.Now, add thin coconut milk and cardamom powder to the pot and bring it to boil.Add sugar and give a stir. Cook for few minutes until the sugar dissolves completely in the milk.Now, add thick coconut milk and turn off the heat. Remove the Paal Kozhukattai  from the heat. Ensure you don’t cook the Paal Kozhukattai after the addition of thick coconut milk.Serve warm or refrigerate for an hour before serving. Paal Kozhukattai tastes delicious either warm or cold.Serve Paal Kozhukattai Recipe With Bananas as a dessert after a festive meal of Steamed Rice, Mixed Vegetable Sambar, Carrot Beans Thoran and Elai Vadam.  \n",

Add broken cashew nuts and fry till they start changing colour. Transfer them to a plate and keep aside.  Extract thick and thin coconut milk and keep them in different bowls.  Add grated jaggery, coconut milk, to a thick bottomed pan or uruli. Heat this mixture until the jaggery melts completely. Strain it to remove impurities. Clean the pan and add the mixture back to the pan. To this add rice flour, little at a time and mix well without lumps.  Cook this mixture on a medium flame, until it starts thickening.  Keep stirring in order to avoid sticking to the bottom of the pan. Once you find that the mixture starts thickening, reduce the flame to low, and add the thick coconut milk. Mix well.  Keep stirring continuously.  When it starts thickening, add 1 tablespoon of ghee.  Keep stirring and cook for another 30 - 35 minutes. Whenever you find the halwa sticking to the sides of the pan, add 1 tablespoon of ghee to the sides of the pan. Cook until the mixture gets a halwa consistency and starts leaving the sides of the pan.  Add roasted cashew nuts at this stage and mix well.  Spread the halwa onto a greased plate and allow it to cool.  Once cool, cut it into desired shapes and serve.    \n"

      "1504  To begin making the Paal Kozhukattai Recipe With Bananas, let us start with preparing the rice dumplings. In a small pot, bring 2 1/2 cups of water to boil. Once the water starts boiling, add sesame oil and turn off the heat.In a bowl, add rice flour and salt. Combine them together. Add water slowly little by little and mix continuously to prepare the dough. Knead the dough together to prepare a soft dough.Once the dough comes together, grease your palm with oil and roll small balls of dough . I rolled the dough into small coin shaped ones as I preferred a different shape than the usual round ones. Ensure the dough is covered with damp cloth all the time to prevent it from losing its moisture. This also prevents the dough from cracking while cooking.Repeat the same with the entire dough and prepare small coins out of the dough. Keep the rolled balls covered with damp cloth at all times.In a nonstick pan, add milk and bring it to boil. Once the milk starts boiling, reduce the heat and add shaped rice balls into the milk.Cook the rice balls for about 5 minutes without stirring. Ensure that you don’t stir the rice balls until they are cooked to avoid breaking the rice balls.The balls will float on the top once it has been cooked.Now, add thin coconut milk and cardamom powder to the pot and bring it to boil.Add sugar and give a stir. Cook for few minutes until the sugar dissolves completely in the milk.Now, add thick coconut milk and turn off the heat. Remove the Paal Kozhukattai  from the heat. Ensure you don’t cook the Paal Kozhukattai after the addition of thick coconut milk.Serve warm or refrigerate for an hour before serving. Paal Kozhukattai tastes delicious either warm or cold.Serve Paal Kozhukattai Recipe With Bananas as a dessert after a festive meal of Steamed Rice, Mixed Vegetable Sambar, Carrot Beans Thoran and Elai Vadam.  \n",

Add broken cashew nuts and fry till they start changing colour. Transfer them to a plate and keep aside.  Extract thick and thin coconut milk and keep them in different bowls.  Add grated jaggery, coconut milk, to a thick bottomed pan or uruli. Heat this mixture until the jaggery melts completely. Strain it to remove impurities. Clean the pan and add the mixture back to the pan. To this add rice flour, little at a time and mix well without lumps.  Cook this mixture on a medium flame, until it starts thickening.  Keep stirring in order to avoid sticking to the bottom of the pan. Once you find that the mixture starts thickening, reduce the flame to low, and add the thick coconut milk. Mix well.  Keep stirring continuously.  When it starts thickening, add 1 tablespoon of ghee.  Keep stirring and cook for another 30 - 35 minutes. Whenever you find the halwa sticking to the sides of the pan, add 1 tablespoon of ghee to the sides of the pan. Cook until the mixture gets a halwa consistency and starts leaving the sides of the pan.  Add roasted cashew nuts at this stage and mix well.  Spread the halwa onto a greased plate and allow it to cool.  Once cool, cut it into desired shapes and serve.    \n"

Drain it and spread on a colander.Pass cold water through it. This ensures that the vermicelli does not become sticky. Keep it aside and let it cool down.Heat a kadai/wok and add oil. Add the peanuts and roast till it turns brownish. Remove and keep it aside.In the same kadai, add more oil if needed and add the mustard seeds and after it splutters add the other ingredients meant for tempering.Add the boiled vermicelli and mix everything. Add salt to taste and mix.Finally just before serving add curd and mix well. Serve Thayir Semiya on its own for a light and healthy lunch or dinner   \n",
      "1      To begin making the Chettinad Style Kara Kuzhambu Recipe, we will first make the masala. Heat a small pan on medium heat; add fenugreek seeds, coriander seeds, fennel seeds, red chillies. Roast these spices until the aroma wafts in the air. Stir in the freshly grated coconut and roast for another 2 to 3 minutes. Turn off the heat and allow the spices to cool. Transfer the spices into a mixer jar, add 1/2 cup warm water and grind to make a smooth paste.To cook the kara kuzhambu, heat oil in a pressure cooker over medium heat; add the onion, garlic and saute for a few minutes until the onion softens. Add the chopped tomatoes and saute until the tomatoes are mushy.Stir in the potatoes, brinjal, jaggery, tamarind water, sambar powder and salt. Pressure cook for 3 to whistles and turn off the heat and allow the pressure to release naturally.In the meantime, make the seasoning; heat oil in a tadka pan; add the mustard seeds and curry leaves and allow it to crackle.
